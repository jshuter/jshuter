**Hi, I’m @jshuter**

I've been working in IT for a while. My first program was saved to Punch Cards, which were carried to the computer center and executed in a batch.  

An hour later we got to see our output, which hopefully would not have failed due to a typo!

I once spent 2 days searching down a bug.  It was a missing period {.}, from the end of a COBOL PERFORM statment, talk about a runwaway sentence...

More later, just ask if you want to know anything. 

**I’m interested in ...**

travel 

**I’m currently learning ...**

C#, ORM, .NET, git, devops, financial systems, a little AI, Black Holes, and the guitar (which I am really very bad at!).

**I’m looking to collaborate on ...**

teaching related projects, perhaps not even development, but something else, like mentoring, teaching, maybe learning to teach...

**How to reach me ...**
